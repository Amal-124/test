Today only the ruins of the 5,000-year-old city remain, but you can still get a sense of its former importance. Built on a hill, it looks out onto an unspoilt stretch of beach and the ocean.On the outskirts of Salalah is Al Balid City, which was an important port during the same time as Samharam. It‚Äôs a sprawling site that was only rediscovered in 1930, with pathways winding through the clearly defined foundations of ancient buildings.",

Diving is only possible during the dry season, from October to the end of May, and this is also the optimal time for bird watching. May and especially June are the hottest months of the year, with humidity steadily increasing until the rains bring relief again in late June or early July.",
